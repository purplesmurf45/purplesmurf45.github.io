In this article we attempt to understand the role of Aadhaar with respect to Public
Distribution System (PDS). PDS started off as a food scarcity management system
that aimed to ration food at affordable prices. Today, this scheme is an important
part of the Indian Government’s policy for the management of the food economy
in the country; targeted towards Below Poverty Line(BPL) families[1]. There are
several issues to consider when we look into the implementation of this system
but the one we will be focusing on within the scope of this article is the
identification of households which are eligible to avail this scheme. Studies have
shown that these targeted mechanisms are prone to large inclusion and
exclusion errors. Almost 61% of the the eligible population were excluded from the
BPL list while 25% of non-poor households were included.[2] Such level of
exclusion errors are unacceptable since it rendered more than half the poor
households ineligible for subsidised food rations and at the same time gave scope
to smuggle PDS foodgrains to black markets[3].

The Unique Identity project (Aadhaar) was launched by the Indian Government
back in 2009 with the objective of collecting biometric and demographic
information to create a unique identification for all citizens of India. Due to its
ability to eliminate duplicates and fake identities, the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery
of Financial and other Subsidies, benefits and services) Act was passed in 2016 by
the Indian Parliament and subsequently seeded with various government welfare
programs, PDS included [4]. This meant that biometrics became the defacto
method for verifying whether a person is eligible for the ration or not. This comes
with its own set of problems.


The introduction of Aadhaar-based biometric authentication (ABBA) might serve
as a means of easy verification to many but this might also be a device of
exclusion to others. This is especially true for people in rural areas, oldage, manual
labourers, specially-abled people, etc. to name a few, who might not even
understand this shift towards the digitization of identification procedures[5].
Further, especially for manual labourers, the constant strain on their fingers
might result in a change of their finger impressions which results in
inconsistencies in Aadhaar’s biometric authentication. This forces them to go
through the gruesome process of updating their biometrics every now and then
if not regularly for them to use these rationing facilities which, again, is a
time-taking process. Other challenges include lack of proper infrastructure,
internet connectivity, etc in remote parts of the country. All these factors lead to
exclusion errors and while many end to end computerization projects of identity
across the world have been focused on inclusion errors, they seldom made
promises of solving the exclusion errors[6].

As Aadhaar authenticated services like PDS are targeted towards low income
(BPL) families, it is usually the job of the female members of these families to get
the rations from the fair price shops (FPS) as the male counterparts are expected
to work for a livelihood. As the living conditions of the beneficiaries involve intense
household chores when compared to others, many times the authentication
services at the ePOS fail causing them to retry again and again, sometimes the
next day or even updating their biometrics. Each time this happens, it causes the
beneficiary to go through anxiety as their trust in the system is in question but at
the same time it is the only way to get their rations for the month. Anxieties of
recognition brought on by biometric authentication pertain to the gap between
the promise of unique identification and dignified living. Aadhaar’s Strategy
Overview (2010) noted that pre Aadhaar identity verification of the poor often
lacked proper documents in order to avail of the benefits and subsidies which is
what has allowed the government to place Aadhaar as a pro-poor identity
verification mechanism that would prevent individuals from representing
themselves ‘differently to different agencies’ [7] but this very single method of
verification can make those female beneficiaries handicapped in situations when
their authentication fails. This can be frustrating, meanwhile this could be
mitigated if the other family member is listed on the same card but it could make
it virtually impossible for single card holders like unmarried individuals or elderly
widows to get these benefits[8]. Availing alternate authentication methods can
be a long and tedious process, sometimes more than 6 months. After ABBA,
beneficiaries’ ability to address their problems at the local level in case of
authentication failure has substantially fallen[8].


While we critique ABBA for exclusion, this very technology has also allowed those
segments (women, transgender, sex workers etc.) of the population that have
been previously excluded from an individual identity[9]. Before this women
tended to have relational rather than individual identity, and Aadhaar introduced
the process of shifting from relational to individualized personal identity[10]. This
has allowed greater mobility or including them from rights and other social
protection payments. This has shown to have not just increased their sense of
personal identity but has given them opportunities to grow in the community as
a stronger individual as many banks and government initiatives give lucrative
benefits for women and women led cooperatives in rural parts of the nation.
While the novelty of Aadhaar stands in being a single form of identity across
various benefit and services offered by the government, issues of improper
seeding in previously existing databases, alternate mechanisms of authentication
in rural areas where network/internet issues still persist and for beneficiaries who
are prone to changes in biometric identification due to the nature of their chores
need to be addressed for such a system to be fully integrated into the social
structure.
