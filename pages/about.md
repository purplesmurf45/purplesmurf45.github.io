# **About Me**

Hello! I'm **Neetha**  \*waves\*, a fourth year Integrated Masters student pursuing Computer Science at <a href = "https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT Bangalore</a>. I am an aspiring competitive programmer. An avid supporter of diversity and inclusion, I am a member of the Lean-In Chapter, IIITB. When I am not trying about cool projects or frantically coding my way through a contest, you can find me reading a book or playing tennis.
