# **About Me**

Hello! I'm **Neetha**  \*waves\*, a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I got my Integrated Masters degree from <a href = "https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT Bangalore</a> majoring in Computer Science. When I am not trying about cool projects or frantically coding my way through a contest, you can find me reading a book or playing tennis.
